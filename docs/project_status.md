# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-05-05

## Current State

Phase 6 is complete. Home, Blog preview, Blog detail, About, Journal, Music, and Contact have all been refined or implemented against the provided concept images. The latest visual pass tightened Home, Contact, and About against their concept screenshots, reduced oversized portrait/avatar presentation, widened the header rail, and recentered the theme-toggle icon. The project now has the target homepage structure, a concept-aligned Blog list composition, a wider Blog detail reading layout without a right sidebar, cleaner code blocks without visible line numbers, larger Blog detail tables constrained to the main reading column, a Codex-docs-inspired syntax palette, standalone editorial layouts for the remaining primary pages, reusable post/media presentation components, category filters, search input, modular styling for hero/cards/article/page surfaces, responsive breakpoints, lightweight motion, refined Blog card hover interactions, project-level SEO metadata, WebP image processing, keyboard-accessible Blog filtering, stronger focus states, and a Music page that uses dedicated music content plus page-bundle album covers instead of Blog post content. Real images now render in their original colors by default.

The project still depends on `hugo-theme-stack`, but the visual shell is now controlled from project-level templates instead of the theme sidebar layout.

## Decisions

- Keep using `hugo-theme-stack` for the underlying Hugo pipeline and theme scripts.
- Do not modify files under `themes/`.
- Use `params.primaryNav` in `hugo.yaml` as the navigation source for the new top header.
- Keep Stack's per-layout footer rendering for now to avoid duplicated footers on theme-provided list/search pages.
- Add `_legacy-bridge.scss` as a temporary compatibility layer until Archives and remaining theme-provided surfaces are rewritten.
- Treat `docs/blog-refactor-plan.md` as the accepted design specification for staged implementation.
- Keep homepage and Blog list free of music playback controls; music remains visual language only.
- Keep the Music page editorial and recommendation-oriented; do not add playback controls, progress UI, or media-player modules.
- Do not apply global grayscale filters to real images or portraits; decorative music shapes and code-native panels can remain monochrome.
- Use light mode as the default visual baseline so the Home page matches the current concept direction; dark mode remains manually toggleable.
- Keep Phase 5 motion below 500ms and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use the footer custom script for small global behaviors only: mobile navigation, back-to-top, reveal, and staff-line parallax.
- Keep Blog card hover interactions layered but restrained: card lift, image push, note movement, arrow response, and a thin hairline reveal without image filters.
- Keep Blog detail code blocks line-number-free, larger, and visually quiet; hide the Stack-generated copy bubble on detail pages.
- Use a restrained technical-doc syntax palette for Blog detail code blocks so code remains readable and token types are clearly differentiated in both light and dark modes.
- Keep generated Blog detail summaries short enough to support the concept composition and avoid repeating the article title.
- Keep Blog detail tables at the same readable scale as the enlarged article body, including table inline code.
- Keep Blog detail pages as a wide no-right-sidebar reading layout; place the quote in the header area and related posts after the article body.
- Use project-level title and description partials instead of relying on the default Stack metadata behavior.
- Prefer WebP derivatives for project-level generated images and Markdown content images while preserving original colors.
- Treat Blog category filters as toggle buttons with keyboard navigation rather than ARIA tabs.
- Keep article body Markdown `h1` headings demoted under the article title so detail pages have a single primary `h1`.
- Keep above-the-fold Blog detail content out of reveal animations to protect LCP.
- Keep the global header rail wider than the main content rail so the logo and theme toggle match the concept-image edge spacing.
- Keep hero portraits smaller and lighter across Home, About, Journal, Music, Contact, and article author surfaces.

## Known Gaps

- Home has been rewritten and refined against the current concept direction.
- Blog list has been rewritten and refined against the current concept direction; client-side filtering currently operates on the rendered post set.
- Blog detail has been rewritten and refined against the current concept direction.
- About, Journal, Music, and Contact have been implemented as static editorial pages using current site content/media resources.
- Music has been refined to use Music-specific front matter data for lyric fragments, albums, songwriters, records, and inspirations instead of querying Blog posts.
- Music album and record entries now support real page-bundle cover images through `layouts/partials/music-cover.html`; uploaded covers preserve their original colors and Favorite Albums covers render as square album crops.
- Project-level real image styles have been reset so newly added images and portraits are not forced to grayscale.
- Phase 5 responsive and motion refinements are complete.
- Phase 6 performance, SEO, and accessibility review is complete.
- Home, Contact, and About received a post-Phase-6 concept-alignment pass for header edge spacing, portrait scale, theme-toggle centering, and first-viewport rhythm.
- Legacy visual scripts `static/js/particles.js`, `static/js/fireworks.js`, and `static/js/avatar-colors.js` have been deleted.
- Remaining optional optimization: deeper CSS pruning could reduce unused CSS reported by Lighthouse, but the current desktop Lighthouse targets are met.
